Installing TaxonFinder
===================

Prerequisites
--------------
Perl



Installation
-------------

Setting up TaxonFinder is a fairly straightforward process, and the software can be run in the foreground or background.

You can download TaxonFinder into any directory. In this example, we use `/data/taxonfinder`.


Configuration
--------------

Once downloaded into your directory, you need to setup the IP address and port for TaxonFinder to bind to.

Edit `server.pl` and replace the IP address and port number on following lines with your environment

##############################################
my $main_socket = new IO::Socket::INET (
        LocalHost => '127.0.0.1',
        LocalPort => '1234',
        Proto => 'tcp',
        Listen => 10,
        Reuse => 1,
    );
##############################################


Running the server
-------------------


Once configured, change into the TaxonFinder directory and run the server using perl:

`cd /data/taxonfinder/`
`perl server.pl`


### Running non-interactively
To run TaxonFinder non-interactively, you can prepend the nohup command so that the process continues when you close the terminal session:

`cd /data/taxonfinder`
`nohup perl server.pl`




Troubleshooting
---------------

###SELinux
On linux systems with SELinux installed, SELinux could inhibit TaxonFinder's functionality. Ensure the appropriate rules are configured in SELinux for your system.

###WordList path
For optimal performance, TaxonFinder relies on wordlists, which are loaded when the application loads. 
In the current version, the load path is relative to the server.pl script, so you must be within the TaxonFinder directory when running the server.
